Something writing to June.

Not very happy for the past few days. Getting cold and broken my angle. 
This is really a big disturbance for me cause I cannot do anything that involves my feet, like any cardio and lower-body training.
And I even need to use a walking stick, this is totally insane.

June was getting cold as well, or maybe covid-19, and she has her own work to do, so she doesn't have spare time to talk with me.
No idea how long this kind of life lasts, hopefully it will end soon. 
Then I can go back to London and start my internship.
