Something writing to June.

Not very happy for the past few days. Getting cold and broken my angle. 
This is really a big disturbance for me cause I cannot do anything that involves my feet, like any cardio and lower-body training.
And I even need to use a walking stick, this is totally insane.

June was getting cold as well, or maybe covid-19, and she has her own work to do, so she doesn't have spare time to talk with me.
No idea how long this kind of life lasts, hopefully it will end soon. 
Then I can go back to London and start my internship.

Recording for angle:
12.03周三 -- 下午16:29在岩舞者崴脚后冰敷，疼痛没有缓解，回家之后休息一段时间更疼
12.04周四 -- 晚上一直疼，睡不好觉，下午去医院拍了CT和核磁，骨头没事，但是两条韧带有损伤，买了护具固定脚踝，医生建议一个月不下地
12.05周五 -- 脚不太疼了，也能暂时落地，但是还是弄了个拐杖。有医生建议打石膏或者做手术
12.06周六 -- 没有打石膏，又买了一个替代石膏的更厚的护具
12.07周日 -- 脚已经几乎没有痛感了，左右弯曲时能感觉到韧带不舒服。脚晚上肿胀程度比早上大很多。
